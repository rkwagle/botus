> *When a Trump tweets, do markets move?*

Inspired by [NPR's Planet Money](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/04/07/522897876/meet-botus-planet-money-s-stock-trading-twitter-bot), this repository provides a tutorial on developing a basic "BOTUS" bot that makes decisions about buying and selling stocks based on the tweets of [@realDonaldTrump](http://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump).

## Disclaimer
- The purposes of this tutorial are informational and educational in nature. Stock trading should be done at your risk / peril; *in fact, BOTUS is probably just as terrible an investing strategy as most.*
- The original BOTUS bot was created by [NPR's Planet Money](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/04/07/522897876/meet-botus-planet-money-s-stock-trading-twitter-bot), not me.  I'm just an inspired fan.
