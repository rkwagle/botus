# Installations and Setups


### Project Twitter Account
Set up a new Twitter from which you can follow just one person. There is more than one way to get Trump tweets, however this way will allow for easy setup and streaming.   https://apps.twitter.com/

### Install Python?
In general, I prefer using the [Continuum's Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) because it contains many commonly used packages in addition to the standard library.  I also suggest going with Python version 3.X for the sake of relative future-proofing.

### Install libraries?


### Set up a Quantopian profile?


### Set up a Robinhood account?


### Add Robinhood to my Quantopian profile?
- Go to your [Quantopian trading profile](https://www.quantopian.com/account#trading)
- Click the 'Add New Trading Account' button
- From the dropdown, choose which brokerage account you wish to add (Robinhood or IB)
- Enter your account nickname (a name used on Quantopian), broker username, and account number (only for IB) on the popup
- On any full backtest (the page you see after running a full backtest) click the 'Live Trade Algorithm' button
